# Kick Start your first AngularJS Application

This project is created using angular-seed boiler plate. Seed is nothing but a boilerplate for quickly bootstraping standard AngularJS application. Folder structure of this project is very important part which every one should check after cloning the repository. Once you understand the main architecture of project, you can scale it to any level. This will give a good kick start for your first AngularJS project. 

Setting up standard architecture is very important stage while creating any new project. So this project will make your job easy. This structure is useful for any type of AnngularJS application. You can use it for small application with 2-3 screens to any large application.

In initial few commits I am trying to set up small application with 2 main features integrated with Yahoo weather public APIs. So this application will also help you to understand various components of AngularJS as well. 

So just setup the application, understand how its done with seed and extend it to any application. Best of luck.
